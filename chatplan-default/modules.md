-------------------------------
Brainstorm:
the problem is that a picture is worth a thousand words.
text an image code to rcv a link to a video or a picture.
there should be a series of pictures in order of importance (or usefulness?)

maybe have a screen available that will display these pictures in response to the messages?

text a problem code to enter troubleshooting for that problem. these should be "detectable problems" including the blink codes
