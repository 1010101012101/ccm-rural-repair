Turn the center dial to the right until the marking points to the V symbol with a straight and dashed line.
This will turn on the tester and allow it to measure electrical voltage.
The voltage of a battery is a measure of how much energy it contains.
Touch the metal tip of the red tester cable to the positive metal contact of the battery, and touch the metal tip of the black tester cable to the negative metal contact of the battery.
The contact should be firm for a good measurement.
Then read the number on the tester screen. That is the battery voltage.
If you switch the tester cables touching the positive and negative sides of the battery, the reading will be negative. 
Be very careful not to connect the positive and negative sides of the battery by accident, as it could cause a fire.

The solar charge controller display should be on and displaying numbers.
The "Out:" voltage should be greater than 12 V. 
The timer should also be on and displaying numbers.
The inverter should be switched on and the fan should be running.
The power strip should be on and the plug locations where equipment is plugged should be switched on. 
If any of these are not true, text 12 to 777 for specific help.
