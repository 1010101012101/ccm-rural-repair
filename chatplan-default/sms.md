"help"
To browse the help guide, text the following codes to 777.
info: more detailed help on each component of the system.
1: one or more components are powered off.
2: you are not able to reach numbers outside your barangay.
3: there is signal but no calls are working. 
4: there is no signal.
5: how to measure electrical voltage of a battery using a multimeter (tester).

"info"
To learn about the system components, text the following codes to 777.
pow: power (batteries, timer, inverter, power strip)
bts: BTS (radyo)
ant: antennas and antenna cables
rou: router and network cables
sat: satellite modem and dish
com: computer
sol: solar panels and charge controller

"5"
Turn the center dial to the right until the marking points to the V symbol with a straight and dashed line.
This will turn on the tester and allow it to measure electrical voltage.
The voltage of a battery is a measure of how much energy it contains.
Touch the metal tip of the red tester cable to the positive metal contact of the battery, and touch the metal tip of the black tester cable to the negative metal contact of the battery.
The contact should be firm for a good measurement.
Then read the number on the tester screen. That is the battery voltage.
If you switch the tester cables touching the positive and negative sides of the battery, the reading will be negative. 
Be very careful not to connect the positive and negative sides of the battery by accident, as it could cause a fire.

12: specific problem solving guides

"10"
The solar charge controller display should be on and displaying numbers.
The "Out:" voltage should be greater than 12 V. 
The timer should also be on and displaying numbers.
The inverter should be switched on and the fan should be running.
The power strip should be on and the plug locations where equipment is plugged should be switched on. 
If any of these are not true, text 12 to 777 for specific help.

13: how to assemble and disassemble the power system

"12"
14: equipment damage from too much electrical current
15: low battery
16: power strip broken

"13"
Look at picture 13 on the back of the solar panels for the solar panel wiring guide.

"ant"
The BTS antenna is responsible for broadcasting the signal to the entire coverage area.
It broadcasts equally in all directions.
To maximize coverage, the antenna should be aligned vertically. 
Without an antenna, there may still be signal near the BTS but it will be weak.
The NuRan BTS uses two antennas.

"coax"
The antenna cable connects the BTS to the antenna.
This type of cable is called "coaxial" cable.
It is very thick and well insulated to increase signal quality.
It should be bent as little as possible to avoid internal damage.
The cable connections to the BTS and the antenna should be waterproofed with electrical tape to avoid water damage.

"bts"
The BTS is a high-powered radio that is able to communicate with every cell phone that is close enough to the tower to receive signal, around 1 km in all directions.  
The BTS brand in Diotorin is NuRan.
It can serve around 10 simultaneous calls and 90 text messages per minute.
It has an indicator light on the bottom showing its status.
