All dialplans are xml files.

File names are prefixed with numbers to determine the sequence in which dialplans will be run upon receipt of a call (originated automatically from the basestation upon detection of an error).

Total number range: 00 through 99

Number range generically used for software sensors and alert enrollment: 04 through 09
04: temp check
05: backhaul check
06: memory check
07: unassigned
08: unassigned
09: unassigned

The dial numbers for now are hardcoded similarly to the chatplan numbers, but are designed to be used for automated alerts rather than user-facing, so there's no enrollment dialplan.
400: temp alert
500: backhaul alert
600: memory alert
